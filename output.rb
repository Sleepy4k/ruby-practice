# After i read ruby code docuemntation, i found that there is a method called
# print which is used to print the output to the screen. and
# puts is used to print the output to the screen and add a new line after the output.

name = "John"
job = "Programmer"

print "Hello, my name is #{name} and i am a #{job}.\n"
puts "Hello, my name is #{name} and i am a #{job}."

# It's same as c++ when we use print we need to add \n to add a new line.
# But in ruby we can use puts to add a new line after the output.
